# Welcome to m1!

This github repo is made for the basic website created as an experiment using the help of [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/discover)[^1] where you can watch MOVIES by giving input the [IMDB ID](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation/key-concepts#:~:text=tt0050083%20is%20the%20unique%20identifier%20for%20the%20movie%20%2212%20Angry%20Men%20(1957)%22%2C%20where%20tt%20signifies%20that%20it%27s%20a%20title%20entity%20and%200050083%20uniquely%20indicates%20%2212%20Angry%20Men%20(1957)%22)[^2] or [TMDB ID](https://themoviedb.org/)[^3]. 
This input further goes to the player using movie streaming API and returns the movie which you can watch online, and also download if the option is available in the player itself.

_**NOTE**: Third party movie streaming APIs are used and I do not own the copyrights or store or host media that is displayed and the rights are to the respective owner of the content. Any copyright claims or complaints should not be done with my name or the website or the github profile._
